# My Mobile Development Setup with Expo

## Why I Chose Expo

Mobile development can be pretty resource-heavy compared to web development, so I decided to go with the **Expo Framework for React Native** to make things easier. It simplifies development and lets me test apps directly on my phone without needing a fancy emulator setup.

Here’s what I needed to get started:

- **Node.js LTS** (for running JavaScript)
- **VS Code** (my go-to code editor)
- **macOS, Linux, or Windows** (any of these work)
- **Expo Go** on my phone (Android or iOS)

With these tools, I was ready to start building apps without worrying about hardware limitations.

## Setting Up Expo Go

1. **Go to the Expo Go page:** [expo.dev/go](https://expo.dev/go)
2. **Pick the latest SDK version.**
3. **Install the app:**
   - **Android:** [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent)
   - **iOS:** [Apple App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/expo-go/id982107779)
4. **Open the app on your device.**
5. **Create an account or log in.**

That’s it — I was ready to scan QR codes and see my apps live on my phone!

## What I Learned

I made sure to keep notes of my setup process so I can look back later if anything goes wrong. In my `README.md`, I documented:

- The installation steps.
- Problems I ran into (and how I fixed them).
- Useful resources I found along the way.
